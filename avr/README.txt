Arduino-Tiny is an open source set of ATtiny "cores" for the Arduino platform.

The Arduino platform currently supports Atmel ATmega processors. There is a need
for the Arduino platform to work with physically smaller DIP package processors.
The intent of this project is fulfill that need. Specifically, our goal is to
provide a core that enables Arduino users to work with the ATtiny84 (84/44/24),
ATtiny85 (85/45/25), and ATtiny2313 processors.

For more information about Arduino, see the website at: http://www.arduino.cc/


      "ATtiny84 @ 16 MHz  (external crystal; 4.3 V BOD)"
      "ATtiny85 @ 8 MHz  (internal oscillator; BOD disabled)"
      etcetera

You are now ready to use Arduino-Tiny!
